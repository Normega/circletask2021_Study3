    "Thanks for completing the study! It focused on how we come to know what is happening in our own bodies. Compared to the external senses, little is known about interoception, the sense of the bodyâ€™s internal state. This research employs a novel approach to the measurement of interoceptive attention." +
    "</p><br><p class='description'> " +
    "The main dependent measure in this task was your ability to detect changes in your breathing when you matched your breath to the circle. We were interested in how reliable this estimate is, which is why we had you do the task twice. We are also interested whether your ability to detect changes in the breath could predict risk taking behavior in the ballon task." +
    "</p><br><p class='description'> " +
    "This research helps to develop tools for understanding body sensation, which could help predict a person's sense of well-being. Breath integration may be a useful way to probe such awareness relative to other tasks that are already used in research." +
